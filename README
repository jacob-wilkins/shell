# Simple Shell

This project is a simple Unix-like shell implemented in C. It supports running external commands, as well as a set of built-in commands.

## Features

- Execute external programs (e.g., `ls`, `echo`, etc.)
- Built-in commands:
  - `exit` — Exit the shell
  - `cd <directory>` — Change the current working directory
- Command-line prompt
- Basic argument parsing (space-delimited)

## Build

To build the shell, use the provided Makefile:

```sh
make
```

This will produce an executable named `shell`.

## Usage

Run the shell:

```sh
./shell
```

You will see a prompt (`$`). Type commands as you would in a regular shell.

### Examples

```sh
$ ls
$ cd /tmp
$ echo Hello, world!
$ exit
```

## Custom Commands

You can add more built-in commands by editing the `commands` table and providing handler functions in `lib/commands.c`.

## Cleaning Up

To remove compiled files:

```sh
make clean
```

## Notes

- This shell is for educational purposes and does not implement advanced features like pipes, redirection, or job control.
- Only basic error handling is provided.

Feel free to extend this shell with more features!
